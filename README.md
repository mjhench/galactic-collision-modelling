# Galactic Collision Modelling
In this project, I used Python to model the collision of the Antennae Galaxies (NGC 4038/NGC 4039) using a teammate's leapfrog integration code. I was responsible for developing the various required object classes, viz. Particle, Galaxy, and GalaxyTools, then using them to construct two galaxies and creating the final data visualizations using the data from the leapfrog integration code. Overall, this project gave me practice with implementing object-oriented programming in Python.

Note: I received permission from the course professor and my group members to post this code.
